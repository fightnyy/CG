            On this website, you can see content which allow you to make HTML canvas
            transparent so that you can write letters inside the canvas. You can
            also put pictures on the canvas.<br />

        </p>

        <p class="alert">
            descriptions in canvas are about webgl and kronous, the company that
            created webgl!<br />
            If you have time, please refer to these stories as they are interesting
            to read!
        </p>
        <div class="emphasize">
            If you don't have time, you don't have to read it (because it's not my
            project's description!)
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explainC">
        <div style="color: aqua; font-size: 20px;">CANVAS</div>
        <pre>
        In order to write on canvas, canvas must be transparent first.
        Otherwise, it'll all be covered and the writing won't be visible. 
        I made it transparent for the first time, but if it's completely transparent, 
        you won't know how far it's canvas and how much it's general space, 
        so I put canvas opacity Button!
        If you make it completely transparent, it comes out white!
        To make the canvas transparent,you should use gl.clearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, a); 
        in here a is alpha value.
        If you set the alpha value to zero, you'll get a full transparency.
        And if you want the cube to be transparent, make a less than 1 in 
        the alpha value of vertexData.
        Also if you Enable the blend the color of the cube will be blended!

        i.e ; gl.enable(gl.BLEND);
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="explainACC">
        <div style="color: aqua; font-size: 20px;">Velocity</div>
        <pre>
        The cube rotates only on the y-axis.
        Press the Upward key to accelerate the speed. When you start, you add 0.01 more. 
        Press the Upward key to accelerate in this way: 0.02 , 0.03 Of course,
        pressing the down direction key will reduce the speed.
        I divided the case of speed into zero and higher than zero.
    </pre>
    </div>
    <br />

    <div class="explainCSS">
        <div style="color: aqua; font-size: 20px;">CSS</div>
        <pre>
        Even if the canvas is transparent,
        the letters cannot be placed inside the canvas so that they do not overlap.
        However, making position absolute and using z-index elements for css can solve this problem.
